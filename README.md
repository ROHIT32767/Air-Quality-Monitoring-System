# Hi

# What Is This?
* This repo contains codes used in a project for the half sem course Embedded Systems Workshop (ESW) at IIITH

# The Project:
* We sense the indoor air pollution levels at the place our node is deployed using various parameters such as CO2, VOC, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature, Humidity
* And then we show the data to user through a nice looking :) Dashboard.
* Visit the dashboard [Here](https://indoor-air-pollution-18.onrender.com/)
* `Note:` This repo only contains the code used for our node and data validations. The code for Dashboard can be found at:
    * `Frontend:` [https://github.com/Abhinavreddy-B/ESW_Frontend](https://github.com/Abhinavreddy-B/ESW_Frontend)
    * `Backend:` [https://github.com/Abhinavreddy-B/ESW_Backend](https://github.com/Abhinavreddy-B/ESW_Backend)

# Repo Structure:
* `Calibrate`: Used to calibrate our data (The data are in CSV files) using python scripts (using linear regression)
* `Deployment`: The final version of code uploaded to ESP32 stays here
* `Final`: Python codes to fetch, create, delete OM2M resources (credentials)

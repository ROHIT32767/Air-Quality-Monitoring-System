# Air Quality Monitoring System
```
Air Quality Monitoring System is a network of sensors that measures indoor air quality in real time. It alerts residents when pollutants rise in levels, so they can take action to protect their health. The system uses Prana Air CO2 sensors, VOC sensors, PM2.5 and 10 sensors to measure a variety of pollutants. The data is displayed using graphs, so residents can easily see how air quality is changing. The Node is deployed in H105-OUR classroom.
```
### Here are some of the benefits of the Air Quality Monitoring System:

1. Alerts residents when pollutants rise in levels, so they can take action to protect their health.
2. Measures a variety of pollutants, including CO2, VOCs, PM2.5 and 10.
3. Displays data using graphs, so residents can easily see how air quality is changing.
4. Is deployed in a convenient location, so residents can easily access it.
```
The Air Quality Monitoring System is a valuable tool for residents who want to protect their health and the environment. It provides real-time data on air quality, so residents can make informed decisions about how to protect themselves.
```
### Here are the parameters that we sense:

1. CO2: Carbon Dioxide
2. VOC: Volatile Organic Compounds
3. PM2.5: Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less
4. PM10: Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less
5. Temperature
6. Humidity
```
We display the data to users through a Dashboard. The dashboard shows the current air quality levels, as well as historical data. The dashboard also allows users to set alerts, so they are notified when pollutant levels rise.

```
We hope that our Air Quality Monitoring System will help residents to improve their indoor air quality.

# Repo Structure:
* `Calibrate`: Used to calibrate our data (The data are in CSV files) using python scripts (using Linear Regression)
* `Deployment`: The final version of code uploaded to ESP32 stays here
* `Final`: Python codes to fetch, create, delete OM2M resources (credentials)
* `backend`: Contains code related to the backend of Dashboard
* `frontend` : Contains code related to the frontend of Dashboard
